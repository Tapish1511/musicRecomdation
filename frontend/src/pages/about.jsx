        <title>About Us - Music Recommendation System Using Sentimental Analysis</title>
        <div class="container">
            <h1>Sentimental Analysis</h1>
            <p>Welcome to our website for the "Music Recommendation System Using <strong>Sentimental Analysis</strong>". Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a type of natural language processing that involves the identification, extraction, and analysis of emotions, opinions, and attitudes expressed in text data. Our music recommendation system uses sentimental analysis to analyze the emotions and moods of different songs and recommend new music based on those emotions. Our algorithm takes into account the listener's listening history, musical preferences, and emotional states to provide personalized music recommendations.</p>

            <h1>Tech Stack Used In Project</h1>
            <p>We believe in using cutting-edge technology to create innovative solutions that make a difference. That's why we have chosen a powerful tech stack to bring our ideas to life. Our stack includes <strong>ReactJS</strong>, the popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces that are fast and efficient. We use <strong>ReactJS</strong> for our front-end development, enabling us to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces that provide an optimal user experience.</p>
            <p>To power our face detection functionality, we utilize <strong>Face API</strong>, a powerful machine learning model that can detect faces in images and videos with high accuracy. With <strong>Face API</strong>, we are able to offer our users an advanced and reliable face detection system that is both robust and scalable.</p>
            <p>For our back-end development, we use <strong>ExpressJS</strong>, a fast and flexible Node.js framework that provides a simple and intuitive way to create powerful web applications and APIs. <strong>ExpressJS</strong> enables us to easily handle complex requests and provide reliable and secure services to our users.</p>
            <p>To store and manage our data, we use <strong>MongoDB</strong>, a powerful <strong>NoSQL</strong> database that provides a flexible and scalable way to store and manage large amounts of data. With <strong>MongoDB</strong>, we are able to easily manage our data and provide fast and efficient access to our users.</p>
            <p>By combining these powerful technologies, we are able to offer our users an innovative and reliable solution that meets their needs and exceeds their expectations. We are committed to using the latest and greatest technology to create solutions that make a difference in the world.</p>
