website will recommend the music according to the expression of person
Music has the power to influence our emotions and mood, and music recommendation systems 
have become increasingly popular as they assist users in discovering new songs based on their 
preferences. However, the effectiveness of such systems can be limited as they do not consider 
the user's current emotional state. To address this limitation, we present a sentiment-based 
music recommendation system using face detection technology. 
The proposed system analyzes the user's facial expressions using a machine learning algorithm 
that is trained to recognize different emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. Based on 
the user's facial expression, the system recommends music that is appropriate for the user's 
mood. The music recommendation algorithm is based on a collaborative filtering approach, 
which analyzes the user's listening history and recommends music that is similar to the user's 
past preferences.
The system utilizes the Last.fm API for fetching music recommendations based on the user's 
preferences and the user's current mood. By incorporating face detection technology, the 
system can provide more personalized and effective music recommendations, as it takes into 
account the user's current emotional state. 
The purpose of this project is to develop a system that can recommend music based on the 
user's current mood, which can enhance the user's listening experience and improve the 
effectiveness of music recommendation systems. The system can be used in various 
applications such as music streaming services, music therapy, and the entertainment industry. 
The project aims to contribute to the field of music recommendation systems and further the 
development of personalized and emotion-based music recommendation.
